IT HAPPENED! Elon Musk JUST Bought Instagram,Elon Musk Fan Zone,2024-09-02T23:59:06Z,uelrpt9H_yA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelrpt9H_yA,Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has just caught the social media Space by storm after buying Twitter the tech icon has initiated a plan of buying Instagram why is Elon buying the photo sharing platform and at what price will the IG purchase be more complicated than the Twitter one join me today in this video as we explore why when and how Elon is buying Instagram Elon Musk is not yet done with the social media industry after taking Twitter private on the 25th of April he has now turned his focus on the photo sharing site Instagram there is no doubt that Elon is a man on a mission and he wants to totally transform the social media space apparently the only way for him to sanitize the social media industry is by taking the various social media networks private the majority of the social media users have welcomed elon's plan of reforming the industry given that it has been very toxic in the past few years the level of concern even goes was hire for a site like Instagram where 40% of the users are below 23 years of age a lot of Youth like the social media site as it gives them a platform where they can share with others communicate with peers and even follow their friends it is unfortunate that such young minds are exploited and bullied on the platform teen girls are the most affected on Instagram it is said that some of them have even lost their lives but how does all of this come to be as earlier mentioned Instagram is is a site that is primarily used for sharing photos and short videos consequently the teens are drawn into a spiral of negative social comparison of their body size and shapes many at times the girls have low self-esteem when their pictures do not attract a good number of likes compared to their peers in the end this leads to stress and depression the Tesla CEO wants to buy Instagram so that he can remove the features that promote comparison in the past the tech icon has noted that most people on IG live a false life the pictures that they post on the site is not a true representation of what happens in their real life in his own words the tech icon says people are posting pictures of when they were really happy they're modifying those pictures to be better looking even if they're not modifying those pictures they're selecting the pictures for the best lighting the best angle a musk emphasize that most people post their good piics just for other people to see that they are doing well in Instagram some of the people that appear to be the happiest may turn out to be the saddest people in reality the Tesla founder and CEO has made it clear that no one will be doing well all the time regardless of their social or financial status another problem that musk seeks to solve in Instagram is the illegal and inappropriate content that is uploaded by users it is regrettable that some users upload pornographic content on the platform which is inappropriate for the big number of teens on the social media site other users on the photo sharing site also post some picks that promote violence the world's richest man also seeks to change the algorithm that is on the site as it causes people to be addicted the addiction comes into play as the algorithm will always recommend post that the user is interested in the time that is wasted on IG can be used to do other things that are more productive similarly most Instagram users are less productive at work as they use most of their time checking on any updates on the social media a site the addiction on the site is also promoted by the various hashtags that are synonymous with the site a very good example is selfie Sunday where the users will share their selfies the Tesla billionaire Elon Musk is also set to reduce the amount of advertising that happens on the social media platform generally ads ruin a person's experience online as they distract a person from what they are focusing on musk is said to introduce a premium service of IG which is similar to Twitter blue the premium IG will probably be costing the same as Twitter blue where users subscribe for $3 per month but the tech icon is soon reducing the amount to $2 per month it is quite interesting to see whether musk will decide to merge Twitter and Instagram or leave them to be Standalone companies just like the case of Twitter musk is expected to pay more money than the current market cap of the platform in the case of Twitter he paid $44 billion while the market cap was $39 billion in the case of Instagram musk is expected to pay around $110 billion given that the company has a market cap of 102 billion it is quite common for the established social media platforms to buy the smaller social media sites in 2014 Facebook now meta purchased WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2006 Google bought YouTube for $1.6 billion today the video streamer is worth much more bringing in more than 28.8 billion dollar in Revenue each year while Elon Musk introduced payment via Dogecoin on Twitter the crypto Enthusiast is said to introduce non-fungible tokens on IG there is a possibility that you have heard the words cryptocurrency and nfts and you could be wondering what is the difference between the two words Wonder no more here's the simple and main difference between the two cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin are fungible which simply means you can exchange one Dogecoin for another as they have the same value but on the other end non-fungible tokens as the name suggests they are not fungible which simply means you cannot exchange one nft with another as each nft has its own unique value an nft is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain here is how it all happens assuming you have a physical asset such as a painting that you greatly treasure nfts gives you a chance of not only owning the painting physically but also in digital sense as such what you have to do is to take a quality pick of the item once you have the pick you can run it in a blockchain so that it gets a unique identity after that you can give your new digital asset a price tag and start selling it online the beauty of it all is that you get to give it whatever price that you want other people who want to own the digital image will have to reach out to you so that you can sell it to them even with your physical painting you won't be able to come up with another Digital Image as the blockchain technology does not allow replication so with the new feature instead of people just posting photos on IG they will now be doing business with the pics there is every possibility that the business-like environment in the platform May reduce the level of toxicity on the site as people will tend to be more professional Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack dorsy is a man who has gained from the world of nfts the Tweet which says just setting up my Twitter was first posted in March 2006 and was auctioned off last year by Mr dorsy for charity Mr aavi bought the tweet in the form of an nft in March 2021 Jack sold the nft for $2.9 million and donated the amount to a charity organization that was fighting covid-19 in Africa but what is mind-blowing is that just a year later Mr aavi is selling the tweet for $48 million success in the social media industry is majorly measured by the number of users that a certain platform has high numers simply mean that the site can easily reach out to many people many advertisers go for a micro blogging site that has more people so that they can reach a high audience so how many users does IG have with roughly 1 billion monthly active users Instagram belongs to the most popular social media networks worldwide the social photo sharing app is especially popular in India and in the United States which has 2011 million and 157 million Instagram users each Facebook is on the top of the social media platforms that have most people as it has more than 3.5 billion users it is followed by WhatsApp which has 2 billion active users the number of WhatsApp users is expected to rise even higher as it is the most popular messaging app in the world Tik Tok which is the most recent has 1 billion people while Elon musk's Twitter has 400 million people having bought Twitter and now Instagram Elon Musk is said to be the king of the social media industry it does seem like we're at a point where all of a sudden it happened fast we're we're beyond words and rhetoric Beyond politics Beyond process right now you have illegal aliens coming into our country many from prisons and many from uh mental institutions and they want to give them votes Elon Musk unequivocally agrees with every action and decision made by a certain individual throughout their entire life endorsing them 100% wholeheartedly I think there's you know people tend to take like say an endorsement as um well I I agree with everything that person has ever done their entire life 100% wholeheartedly and that's that's not going to be true of anyone um but we have to pick you we got two choices really for for who's President and it's not not just who's president but the entire admin administrative structure uh changes over um and I thought Trump displayed uh courage Under Fire objectively um you know he's uh just got got blood streaming down his face and he's like pist pumping saying fight you know like that's uh impressive like you can't Fain bravery in a situation like that um like most people would have be ducking there would not be cuz it could be a second shooter you don't know um the the president United States got to represent the country and uh they're representing you they're representing everyone in America well think you want someone who is strong and courageous uh to represent the country um that's not to say that he is without flaws we all have flaws um but on balance um and certainly at the time it was um a choice of you know Biden po poor guy you know has trouble climbing a flight of stairs and the other one's P pumping after getting this is no no comparison I mean who do you want dealing with uh some of the toughest people in you know other world leaders who are pretty tough themselves and um I mean I'll tell you like what are the things that I think are important um you know I think we want a secure border we don't have a secure border um but we want safe and Clean Cities I think we want to reduce the amount of spending that were at least slow down the the spending musk warns that the current rate of expenditure is on a trajectory to bankrupt the nation a fiscal disaster in the making and uh because we're we're currently spending at a rate that is bankrupting the country the interest payments on US debt this year exceeded the entire defense department spending if this continues all of the Federal Government taxes will simply be paying the interest and then and you you keep go going down that road and you end up you know in the tragic situation that Argentina had back in the day Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous places in the world and hopefully with Malay taking over he can restore that but um it's it was an incredible fful Grace for Argentina to go from being one of the most prosperous places in the world to um being very far from that so I think we should not take American prosperity for granted um so we really want to I think we we've got to reduce the size of government we've got to reduce the spending and we've got to live within our means you have to really have take an active role in reducing the number of laws and regulations otherwise as more and more laws and regulations are passed eventually everything becomes IL legal right right um and you start getting into these oan situations where then everyone's poor and miserable well well where where action a is illegal and action B is illegal and there isn't anything you can do that is legal take an example of of um to give example of some some laware that was leveled against SpaceX for example we were told for many years that we could not hire anyone who was not a permanent yeah right so SpaceX develops Advanced rocket technology which is considered um uh an advanced weapons technology because it's it's a core part of like inter intercontinental ballistic missiles y so there are only a handful of things in the sort of highest level of weapon technology and and Rocket technology is one of those because we could deliver a payload and basically anywhere on earth right from anywhere on Earth so um so we he reveals that the government explicitly threatened him with imprisonment if he hired anyone who wasn't a permanent resident of the United States I was told in no uncertain terms by the government that if we hired anyone who is not a uh permanent resident of the United States uh have either green card or a citizen that I would go to prison oh yeah um because the presumption if somebody's not a permanent resident is that they will leave the United States and take the rocket technology from SpaceX to potentially to countries that will cause harm to the United States right right pretty you know solid reasoning I think hey let's pay attention to what people actually want and the lack of interest in that question in Washington is something that ultimately drove me out of the city after 35 years lawmakers stepping over the prostrate bodies of their fellow citizens oding on to go cast votes to send money to some foreign country yeah actually we've lost more Americans from in the past four years than we lost in World War II yeah our bloodiest more than we lost in World War II does anybody care it is pathetic it is pathetic and do you hear a single word from Washington about doing anything about we know where are coming from we know the supply routes the US military spent billions the hoian trail you don't see our commanderin-chief suggesting that we use our military to protect our country or the lives of its citizens no that's for and it's too much actually it's too insulting it's too insulting it's a middle finger in the face of every American it's a very clear statement which is unmistakable and that is we don't care about you and Donald Trump whatever you say about him and I think he's a wonderful person I know him well by the way the the funniest person I've ever met in my life actually you can't be funny without perspective or without empathy which is true but everything else about Trump aside he actually cares because he's interested in the people who lives here live here because that's his job a father's job his duty is to his family an officer's duty is to his men a President's duty is to his citizens Tucker Carlson posits that had the Ambush on Trump succeeded Biden would have undoubtedly remained a presidential candidate altering the political landscape I think it's pretty clear that if the attempt on Trump had succeeded that Biden would have stayed in people can draw their own conclusions from that but I I believe that it seems obvious to me that all of these things are connected it does seem like we're at a point where all of a sudden happened fast were were beyond words and rhetoric Beyond politics Beyond process even and we're dealing with people who are absolutely W to other people for power like that's real of course and um and to Stage a coup against an elected president who supposedly got 15 million more votes in any president where all the the Biden voters nobody even cares about all that stuff none of that was ever real now they're admitting it's not real and it's just the people with the guns are in charge it does feel that way way I'm that does not surprise me based on what I've seen in the United States over the past 20 years so I don't think you know I look as long as we're throwing out all of our standards and norms and traditions and we're starting at year zero which is clearly the goal here when comma says you know we're unburdened by the past what she's really saying is that's welcome to campuchia exactly um then we should just be completely honest about everything all the time why not I mean they already would kill you if they could so why don't just be totally honest and I'm just kind of interested in this idea of female political leadership being this thing that it it demonstrably isn't and so why do we feel why does the right feel like we have to go along with these pities which are clearly lies like why let's just stop doing that this is not plausible this kid's a 20-year-old much bullied socially awkward weird kid who washes out of the rifle team because he can't he's got no social media profile he his search history suggests no Research into any of this and he he already he sounds way too sophisticated cson questions the secret service's failure asking how a counter sniper could Overlook a man with a rifle just 140 yards away and not neutralize the threat so how from the video we we have all seen the counter sniper secret service counter sniper is lying prone and he clearly has the shooter in his in his glasses he's looking at him he does not the sniper until after the sniper Trump how how could a a secret service counter sniper look at a man with a rifle 140 yards away and not him I don't understand that this is the point where the Secret Service is incumbent on them to prove that they didn't allow this kid to Trump because it certainly looks like they did allow it and so I don't understand where you know why there isn't a delegation of senators and members of Congress and citizens standing outside blocking the entrance to the Secret Service headquarters to find you know answer the question you are I think based on everything you've said they are presumed guilty now they may not be guilty but they have an obligation to explain how they're not guilty and no one is forcing that explanation the attempted of trump just shows how serious these people are how high the stakes are and I just hope people are internalizing that lesson but they don't seem to be at all Biden was the worst president in the history of our country she's acknowledged to be the worst vice president in the history of our country she doesn't have a clue you know if she doesn't have a teleprompter she can't even speak did you see her the other night they put a camera in her face she can't even talk we just went through four years let's not go through another four Trump criticizes the Biden administration's deals asserting that his leadership rectified those detrimental agreements restoring normaly we got our people back but boy we make some horrible horrible deals and it's nice to say we got them back but does that set a bad precedent Bert right does that set a bad does that set a bad precedent Bert Harris has the most Ultra leftwing agenda of any presidential candidate ever in history there's never been anybody like this she is considered more left-wing than crazy Bernie Sanders look at her she's worse than Bernie and she happens to be really a low IQ individual she really does she has a very low IQ we don't need a low IQ president shei of China said oh good we have another one a low IQ individual they love dealing with low IQ they love dealing with low IQ people and they got them here I'll tell you we got them all she is terrible she's worse than he I think she's worse than him by the way they really took it away from the guy right I don't feel sorry for him because he's a bad guy you know he's weaponized the whole thing and nobody's ever done that in this country but he's a bad guy but uh people feel sorry for him they did a coup he just doesn't know it but actually he does know it you know that they said Joe you got 14 million votes it's yours but you're going to give it up going to give it up right now Joe you're giving it up right now no I'm not I was elected democratically I was elected now you're giving it up Jo we're either going to do it the nice way or the hard way Joe you're getting the hell out for the most part uh people are protected by their unions by their police unions or by their police departments but I'm saying if if I felt or if if a group of people would feel that somebody was being unfairly prosecuted because the person did a good job maybe with or made a mistake an innocent mistake there's a big difference between being a bad person and making an innocent mistake but if somebody made an innocent mistake I would want to help that person he also claims that illegal immigrants are being welcomed into the country with the promise of votes undermining the Democratic process I can tell you this right now you have illegal aliens coming in to our country many from prisons and many from uh mental institutions and they want to give them votes I don't think they should have votes they came into our country illegally and they're taking the vote away from all of the people in this room that have been here a long time that have worked hard that in many cases and you'll see this happening if I'm Not Elected you're going to see it happening if I am you're not going to have any problem but you're going to see it happening a long time you're going to see the people in this room and people outside of this room are going to be losing their jobs the people that have come into this country illegally I think it's a very rude introduction I don't know exactly why you would do something like that and let me go a step further I was invited here and I was told my opponent whether it was Biden or Camala uh I was told my opponent was going to be here it turned out my opponent isn't here you invited me under false pretense and then you said you can't do it with zoom well you know where's Zoom she's going to do it with zoom and she's not coming and then you were half an hour late just so we understand I have too much respect for you to be late they couldn't get their equipment working or something Mr President I would love I have answer the question you another I have been the best president for the black population since Abraham Lincoln that's my answer I watched the video of what happened in Butler Pennsylvania about 1550 times I think I was one of about 8 billion people around the world who watched it and the more I watched it the more it struck me that everything was different after that moment everything this convention is different the nation is different the world is different Donald Trump is different when he stood up after being in the face bloodied and put his hand up I thought at that moment that was a transformation this was no longer a man well I think that I think it was divine intervention the attempt on Trump's life instead of weakening him solidified his position as the leader of the nation a pivotal moment in his career but the effect that it had on Donald Trump he was no longer just a political party's nominee or a former president or a future president this was the leader of a Nation I think there's a difference I think I mean I'm I've spent most of my life in Washington where the you know the president is the at the top of the pyramid every wants to be the president but if you think about in the presidency comes with great power obviously but if you think about it that is a title that is bestowed by a process of some sort that can be subverted and in the end it does not confer by itself as no title does legitimacy just cuz you call yourself the president doesn't mean that much inherently I can call my dog the CEO of huet Packard it doesn't mean she is you know it's it's true and you hate to say it but it is also true is a fact that you could take I don't know a mannequin a person and make him president if you no you could you could I'm just saying theoretically possible with enough with enough cheating that could happen but being a leader is very different it's not a title it's organic you can't name someone a leader a leader is the bravest man that's who the leader is that is true in all human organizations this is a law of Nature and in that moment Donald Trump months before the presidential election became the leader of this nation that was the most obvious to me and I have to say you know I I I think it changed him I I know Trump expressed his amazement at The crowd's Bravery and composure during the tragedy noting how they didn't flee in panic reached out to Trump within hours of it that night and what he said to me that night having just been in the face he said not a single word about himself he said only how amazed he was and how proud he was of the crowd which didn't run and I thought two things the first thing I thought was well of course they didn't run his courage gave them heart a leader courage gives courage to his people and the second thing I thought was this is the selfish guy I've been hearing about for 9 years really not a word about himself about his people period and the second thing I notice which I don't think anyone has remarked upon in public but I'm just going to since I don't have a script like why not is that he turned down the most obvious opportunity in politics to inflame the nation after being to inflame the nation which is an opportunity that almost every other politician I've ever met and certainly his opponents would have taken instantly and they would have said well what is this how did he get like how did this happen and those are real questions that we have to get to the bottom of but in the moments the days the week after he did not say that he did his best to bring the country together and I thought this is the divisive figure this is the irresponsible person no this is the most responsible unifying behavior of a leader I think I've ever seen and I could go on for hours but I let me just sum it up I do think the entire point from the famous escalator ride 9 years ago until today of Donald Trump's public life has been to remind us of one fact which is a Leader's duty is to his people to his country and to no other that's the point that's the only point and another word for this is democracy Carlson states that true democracy is the belief that the citizens of a country are its rightful owners a principle Under Siege democracy in case you're a little sick of being beaten in the face with democracy on television actual democracy is the proposition that the citizens of a country own that country they're not renters they're not surfs they're not they are the owners of the country and for that to be true their leaders have to represent them which another way of saying they have to do what the people want them to do or a close approximation thereof but if they completely ignore what people want not just one year but generationally say for 50 years then it may be I don't know what it's not a democracy and so I think the entire Trump project paradoxically is attacked as an enemy of democracy is to return democracy to the United States the first thing there's there's one question about Trump that I really wanted to ask you so do you are you shocked at the fact that you're donating a substantial amount of money to facilitate Trump's election is that something you would have believed in the realm of possibility say 5 years ago and I want to diversify out into California what what's been reported in the media is is simply not true um I'm not donating $45 billion a month to Trump now now what I have done is I've I have created a a pack or super pack whatever you want to call it um some we call it the the America pack um and the you want to tell everybody who's listening what a pack is because people it's a political action committee yeah um it's an organization it's sort of a legal entity that can receive funding um that funding can then be used to help with political campaigns
